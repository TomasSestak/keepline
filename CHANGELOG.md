# keepline

## 0.1.0

Initial release.

A typed, dependency-free WebSocket client with a framework-agnostic core and React bindings.

- **Reconnection** — truncated exponential backoff with jitter on by default, a retry budget, and a refusal to retry auth failures or protocol errors
- **Liveness** — heartbeats with RTT measurement and half-open detection, a `staleAfterMs` silence watchdog, and a handshake timeout
- **Outbound queue** — bounded, flushed in order on open, with configurable overflow behaviour
- **Subscriptions** — `subscribe`/`unsubscribe` pairs replayed on every reconnect
- **Request/response** — `socket.request()` with matching, timeout, and `AbortSignal` support
- **Validation** — inbound messages checked by any [Standard Schema](https://standardschema.dev) library, with decode and validation failures surfaced as events rather than thrown inside a socket handler
- **Status** — eight real states, including `reconnecting`, `paused` and `gave-up`
- **Environment awareness** — optional pause while the tab is hidden, and immediate reconnect on `online`
- **Observability** — one typed event stream, with `keepline/sentry` and `keepline/logger` adapters
- **Testing** — `keepline/testing` ships a scriptable `MockWebSocket`
- **Migration** — `keepline/compat` provides a drop-in `useWebSocket`
